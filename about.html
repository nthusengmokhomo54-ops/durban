    <p>
      Durban’s history is deeply intertwined with the arrival of the Zulu people, the British settlers, and the Indian indentured laborers who helped shape the city’s cultural diversity. Founded in 1835 and named after Sir Benjamin D’Urban, the city has grown into a thriving port and cultural center.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fusion of African, Indian, and European influences gives Durban a unique charm. Visitors can experience this rich heritage through its architecture, art, and festivals that celebrate unity in diversity.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Durban’s culture is a living, breathing tapestry — woven from generations of stories, music, and flavors.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Today, Durban is known not only for its stunning beaches and bustling markets but also for being the heart of Zulu Kingdom traditions. From the rhythmic beats of traditional dance to the aroma of spicy curries, every corner of the city tells a story.
